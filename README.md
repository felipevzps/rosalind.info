### About 
This repository hosts my Python solutions for rosalind.info problems!

### Directory Description
**Python Village**: Stores codes with initial troubleshooting to learn some Python basics.

**Bioinformatics Stronghold**: Contains intermediate algorithms used to solve problems underlying various topics in bioinformatics (computational mass spectrometry, alignment, dynamic programming, genome assembly, genome rearrangements, phylogeny, probability, string algorithms and others).

**Bioinformatics Armory**: Hosts algorithms which we will use bioinformatics tools to solve the exercises available on the platform (exercises similar to those found in Bioinformatics Stronghold).
